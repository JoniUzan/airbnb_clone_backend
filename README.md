- **Image Uploads**: Integrated with **Cloudinary** for handling media assets.
- **Geolocation**: Utilizes Google Maps API for storing and retrieving location data.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for scalable application development.
- **Express**: Framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user, listing, and reservation data.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time, bi-directional communication for chat.

- **Models**: MongoDB schemas for users, listings, and reservations.
- **Middlewares**: Handle authentication, error handling, and data validation.
- **Services**: Encapsulate reusable functionalities (e.g., email notifications, Cloudinary uploads).

## Highlights
- Scalable and secure architecture.
- Real-time communication using WebSocket.
- Integrated with external APIs (Cloudinary, Google Maps).
